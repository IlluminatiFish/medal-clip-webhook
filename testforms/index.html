  <!-- This version will not be on the same level with the live one on my website, 
since this one is written in HTML opposed to the live one written in PHP, which cannot be rendered unless you have a localhost server OR a test server. 
It is in this repo, so feel free to use it, this one just has less elements & can run on a normal Windows PC. -->
