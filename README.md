<p align="center">Ever needed a second method to share your clips to Discord or Guilded but don't have the space for Medal, are building a community or are on Guilded and don't have MedalBot?<br>
<strong>You've come to the right place!</strong></p>

<p align="center">This webhooks backend is developed in Node.js, frontend uses plain Javascript, and POSTs to a basic webhook! Platforms that can be POSTed to are Discord, Guilded, or maybe even Slack (if you're looking into that???)!<br>
This webhook is mainly for users who are building a community but don't clip games and just want a way for your users to share clips and/or are on Guilded or Slack (or any other social media service that accepts webhooks).<br>
However, this webhook does not have some things that Medal has, like auto-uploading, integrated uploading, and more. I still sincerely recommend using <a href="https://medal.tv/download">Medal</a>, maybe even use my <a href="https://medal.tv/?ref=awex_partner">partner link</a> ;).</p>

<h2 align="center">A key point..</h2>
	<p align="center"><strong>First point</strong>: If you'd like to self host this, it is expected you have at least <i>some</i> experience with Javascript and API fetching (Node or vanilla frontend JS, can always use the prebuilt API ðŸ˜›) , however I'm happy to help and answer any questions you may have regarding setting this up! You should check out the <a href="https://github.com/awexxx/medal-clip-webhook/wiki">wiki</a> for more info on self-hosting this script.</p>

				<h2 align="center">how to do the thing tho</h2>
					<p align="center">Well, you can do it <i>really</i> easily!<br>
						Navigate over to this <a href="https://awexxx.xyz/mcw">project site</a> and put in your information. <i>Do note none of this information is saved to a database at this moment, so all it's doing is passing your URL to Discord).
